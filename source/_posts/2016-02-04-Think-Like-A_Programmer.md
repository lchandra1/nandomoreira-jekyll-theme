Hey Computer Programmers!

My name is Luke Chandra and this is my first blog post. I am a coding beginner and have recently been tasked with writing about a computer programmer’s mindset.

Judging from the three articles I read, it is clear to me that one must have an open mind, high goals, and an excitement to fail in order to reach your greatest potential as a programmer. Because computer programming seems so foreign to us when we begin learning it, it is crucial that one must be prepared to fail time and time again in order to improve. As explained in Allison Katpur’s blog, failure is the key to learning, and with every failure comes a greater, deeper, understanding. The idea of failing to improve is omnipresent in the coding world because creating clean, functioning, code takes a long process of trial and error. Even in my very elementary coding tasks, I have noted the importance of failure. When I miswrite a code in Terminal, I learned that the best way to correct my mistakes is to try running my program, even if I know it won’t work. This is beneficial because when you get the error message, you still have the opportunity to go back and correct your work (and Terminal tells you which lines to go back to which helps a lot).

Another key concept I noted from my readings was the distinct difference between a fixed and a growth mindset.  Carol Dweck, a Stanford psychologist and author, writes about this theory of two mindsets. She states that someone with a fixed mindset is complacent and believes that he or she is not extraordinary in anyway; whereas someone with a growth mindset believes that he or she has no boundaries and can do anything they put their mind to. Clearly, Dweck is suggesting that a growth mindset is best if you have dreams of becoming an expert coder. With something like computer programming, it is necessary to have this mindset because it is easy to think that you are not good at it. Having high expectations and goals, in addition to not being afraid of failure at two key qualities to have if you want to be a good programmer.
