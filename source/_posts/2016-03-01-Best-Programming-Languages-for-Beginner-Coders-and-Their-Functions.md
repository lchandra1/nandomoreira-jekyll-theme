Good Morning Computer Programmers!

Today we are going to discuss the best programming languages for first-time learners, their specific functions, and why they are good for beginners.

All computer programmers must begin their coding careers by starting with one language. Although many famous coders have started with different languages, many sources suggest that the language you first learn can greatly affect your development as a computer programmer. Today we are going to look at three of the best beginner coding languages to learn according to lifehacker.com, udemy blog, and Mashable.

The first language we are going to look at is Java. Oracle’s Java is one of the Internet’s oldest and most influential programming languages. Alan Henry from lifehacker.com says, “It’s a deeply featured class-based, object-oriented programming language that’s designed to be portable and workable on as many platforms as possible,” Because of this, he suggests it is one of the world’s most useful coding languages. Having said that, however, many programming experts believe Java isn’t a perfect programming language because it is difficult to learn and grasp. For this reason, many computer science teachers believe in teaching C or C++.

C is an extremely widely-used, general purpose programming language that has heavily influenced many languages that have followed it. C++ is also a very popular programming language that is used for anything from video games to productivity software. Experts say that although C++ is more difficult to learn, they argue that there is no point in starting with C anymore. According to Henry, C and C++ are, “some of the most foundational languages in computer science and programming,” 

The last language we are going to look at is Ruby. Ruby, a code developed by computer scientist Yukihiro Matsumoto in the 90s, is one of youngest languages in broad use. Ruby is a dynamic object-oriented language the was designed to have syntax that is easy to read and write by humans. To be a good Ruby coder, unlike many other languages, you do not need to have a tremendous knowledge of commands and specialized vocabulary. Because of this, personally, I believe it is the best code for beginners.
